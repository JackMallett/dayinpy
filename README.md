# Find your birthday in Pi

Pi is an irrational number, it continues infinitely without any pattern or repeating sequence. This means that, when converted to numbers, **Pi contains everything that ever has been and ever will**. While this is technically true, in practice once the string you are searching for becomes too long, searching for it becomes exceptionally difficult.

This programs searches through the first **One Billion Digits** of Pi for your birthday (or any other date for that matter). `dateinpi.py` searches the first billion digits for every date from 01/01/1900 - 12/31/2022 and saves it to a `.csv` file which `mydateinpi.py` searches through.
